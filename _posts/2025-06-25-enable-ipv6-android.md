Struggling with IPv6 implementation in global network is type of suffering that never end, especially in Mobile Network sphere. Based on observation by [Dendy Octavian](https://denzveloper.github.io/IPv6-ISP-List) only 1 out of 4 mobile network provider in Indonesia that support IPv6.

| Operator | IPv6 | Always Avaiable | Public IP | Header IP | Performance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Telkomsel  | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❔  | ❔ |
| ID-SAT/3  | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❔  | ❔ |
| Smartfren  | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❔  | ❔ |
| XL/Axis  | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | 2400:: | ✔️ |

###### *Info Symbol meanings: ✔️: OK (Available)/Best, ❌: NO (No Available)/Bad, ❔: No Data  
###### *in some application and cases maybe IPv6 not avaible because is disable/turn off on WAN Settings or APN Settings

Luckily there's a solution called [IPv6droid](https://flyingsnail.de/). The apps itself is open source and hosted on codeberg. You can just download from the release page or install it through F-Droid Izzyondroid Repository.

Their [wiki](https://codeberg.org/Flying-Snail/IPv6Droid/wiki/Home) is pretty easy to read and the developer  is really responsive and friendly.

To connect, you must supply the certificate manually, by contacting the support email, and give your fingerprint (auto-generated by the apps) and then voila. IPV6 BABY :grin:

As you can see the server for the IPv6 is pretty far from my country Indonesia (Hetzner is Germany). This will of course introduce some latency, but with the free service and convenience, who can complain.

The addition of support of IPv6 for the mobile network will open whole new of opportunity, especially in IoT space. Next time maybe I will try to follow the guide and install my own IPv6droid server for more device support.

Based on that we can conclude some limitation, but it's normal, especially with experimental software like IPv6droid: 
- You can't get it from Playstore.
- IPv6 tunnel connection is manually approved by the dev via support email by submit your unique fingerprint.
- No root support to circumvent VPN.  

I hope with support from community and the passion of the developer, the software will keep improving.

Cheers. and Thanks a lot for the free software Mr Andreas.
