This article is written on public demand. Fleetwood Mac in general and Stevie Nicks in particular have been perennial favorites. Recently, I shared a video of them performing a live version of their song Rhiannon at Studio Instrument Rentals in 1976 with a few friends, and all of them struggled to understand the lyrics towards the end part where Stevie goes berserk and the performance hits its crescendo. Some of them are smart people, and they tried searching various song lyrics provider websites, yet they were unable to find the lyrics for this particular version. So they requested that I share the lyrics with them, and I obliged, as friends do. One of them suggested that it'd be a good idea if I could put it on my blog, as it'd be accessible to countless others searching for this particular version's lyrics. So, here you go, folks. I've done my best to transcribe the lyrics as accurately as I possibly can, but if you spot any errors, please contact me, and I'll be more than happy to correct them.

This is a song about a Welsh witch  

Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night  
And wouldn't you love to love her?  
She rules her love like a bird in flight  
And who will be her lover?  

All your life you've never seen  
A woman taken by the wind  
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?  
Will you ever win?  

She is like a cat in the dark  
And then she is the darkness  
She rules her life like a fine skylark  
And when the sky is starless  

Once in a million years, a lady like her rises  
Rhiannon, you cry, but she's gone  
And your life knows no answer  
And your life knows no answer  

Rhiannon (4X)  

She rings like a bell through the night  
And wouldn't you love to love her?  
She rules her life like a bird in flight  
And who will be her lover?  

Once in a million years, a lady like her rises  
Rhiannon, you cry, but she's gone  
And your life knows no answer  
And your life knows no answer  

Rhiannon (4X)  

Taken by, taken by the sky (3X)  

Dreams unwind  
Love's a state of mind  
Oh, now you know that  
Your dreams unwind  
Love's a state of mind  
I know you know that  
Your dreams unwind  
And love is hard to find, you know, you know  
Dreams unwind  
It's still a state of mind, I know, I know  
Dreams unwind  
And love is hard to find  
Dreams unwind  
It's still a state of mind  
Take me like the wind now  
Take me with the sky  
Take me like the wind, baby  
Take me with the sky  
All the same, all the same, all the same  
Rhiannon  
All the same, all the same, all the same  
Would you take me with you to the sky  
All the same, all the same, Rhiannon  
All the same, all the same, all the same  
Won't you take me with you to the sky  
Dream on  
Try hard; you can leave her  
Dream on; you can dream on  
Try hard, ah  
Take me with you to the sky  
Dream on, dream on, yeah  

Lyrics by Stevie Nicks  

> Her Rhiannon in those days was like an exorcism.  
~ Mick Fleetwood
